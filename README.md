# Learning to Approximate: Auto Direction Vector Set Generation for Hypervolume Contribution Approximation  

The data is organized as below:

- Folder **LtA** contains training solution sets and learned direction vector sets for the learning process of LtA.
- Folder **VectorSets** contains the direction vector sets generated by DAS, UNV, JAS, MSS-D, MSS-U, Kmeans-U.
- Folder **CIR_solution_sets** contains the solution sets for the Correct Identification Rate experiment.
- Folder **Candidate_solution_sets** contains the candidate solution sets for the GAHSS experiment.
- Folder **LtA-S** contains the single traning solution set and the learned direction vector sets based on it.
- Folder **LtA-M** contains the modified direction vector set based on the learned direction vector sets.

This paper has been submitted to a journal for review. The source code of LtA will be released if the paper is published or the reviewers request.
